1. Suppose that you earned $100,000 in lottery winnings. How much of the $100,000 would you be willing to invest in an asset to either HALVE or DOUBLE in two years time with equal probability? (1 = 0%, 2 = 10%, 3 = 20%, 4 = 30%, 5 = 40%, 6 = 50%, 7 = 60%, 8 = 70%, 9 = 80%, 10 = 90%, 11 = 100%)

2. Imagine that we role a fair, six-sided die 1,000 times. Out of 1,000 roles, how many times do you think the die would come up even (i.e. 2, 4, or 6)? (min = 0, max = 1000)

3. In the BIG BUCKS LOTTERY, the chances of winning a $10.00 prize is 1%. What is your best guess about how many people would win a $10.00 prize if 1,000 people each buy a single ticket to BIG BUCKS? (min = 0, max = 1000)

4. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? (min = 0, max = 2)

5. If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? (min = 0, max = 1000)

6. In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake? (min = 0, max = 1000)

7. On a scale of 1 to 9, how would you describe your political views with 1 being extremely liberal (i.e. to the left of the Democratic Party), 5 being centrist (i.e. falling between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party), and 9 being extremely conservative (i.e. to the right of the Republican party). (multiple choice; 1 - 9)

8. Do you support gerrymandering (the manipulation of the boundaries of electoral constituencies to favor one election outcome over another). (1 = Y, 2 = N)

9. What is your gender? (1 = F, 2 = M, 3 = Other/wish not to answer)
