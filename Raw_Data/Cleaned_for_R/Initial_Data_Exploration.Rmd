We are interested in a more reasonable naming device to provide a better way to think about each map. 

For the gerrymandered maps we refer to them as $Gerry_i$ for $i \in \{A,B\}$ where $i$ identifies the player for whom the map is gerrymandered (Player A is advantaged in $Gerry_A$). That is, Map 1 will be $Gerry_B$ and Map 5 will be $Gerry_A$.

As the remaining maps are symmetric at the player level we reference $Sym_{d,z}$ for $d \in \{1,3\}$ and $z \in \{1,3\}$ where $d$ denotes the number of competitive districts and $z$ denotes the number of zones within each competitive district. That is, Map 2 will be $Sym_{1,1}$, Map 3 will be $Sym_{1,3}$, and Map 4 will be $Sym_{3,1}$.

For reference:

![]("Maps_Image")

Reading from left to right we have Gerry_B, Symm_1_1, Symm_1_3, Symm_3_1, and Gerry_A.

Note that in Gerry_A, Gerry_B, Symm_1_1, and Symm_1_3 the white district is the only competitive district in the sense that only the competition within the white district determines whether a subject wins that Map. The exception is Symm_3_1 in which it is logical to bid in any district as no district is guaranteed a victor.

The first figure depicts the map choices during the final stage for all participants. The second figure is of interest because we might have spillover from the previous stage whereby participants choose the map they have been choosing without really paying attention to the implications...or they could just be flipping the coin that they are the "incumbent" after randomization occurs.

Now we are addressing:


1) For the map where they should be bidding on every region, I would like to see player A’s 3 CDFs overlaid on top of each other because there’s no reason for them to differ but it’s hard to tell in the version you sent. 

2) I would also like to see player B’s CDFs overlaid

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
df_clean <- df_clean %>% mutate(subject.id = as.numeric(Session)*8-(8-as.numeric(Subject)))
df_all_cdf <- df_clean %>% dplyr::select(Period, subject.id, Player, District, Map, Effort)

only.4 <- df_all_cdf %>% filter(Map == 4, District == c("EDG","ELG","EW")) # %>% group_by(subject.id, District, Effort)

ggplot(only.4, aes(x = as.numeric(Effort), size = "1")) + 
  stat_ecdf(aes(colour=District)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed") + xlim(0,80)+
  facet_wrap(~Player) +
  ggtitle("Symm_3_1") + guides(size = F)
```


3), 4), & 5) Separately I would like to overlay player A and B’s CDFs for districts 1-3 in the map where they bid on all districts since there’s no reason for these to differ. 

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
symm.3.1.cdf.all <- ggplot(df_all_cdf %>% 
         filter(Map == 4, District == c("EDG","ELG","EW")), aes(x = as.numeric(Effort), size = "1")) +
  stat_ecdf(aes(colour=Player)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed") + xlim(0,80)+
  facet_wrap(~District)+
  #ggtitle("Symm_3_1 by District") +
  guides(size = F)
symm.3.1.cdf.all
```

\newpage


6) & 7) On each of the two maps where the players are symmetric and only bidding on one district I would like to see their CDF‘s overlaid. 

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
df_map_2 <- df_clean %>%

  #ggtitle("Symm_1_3: White District") + 
  guides(size = F)
symm.1.3.cdf
```

8) Overlay the CDFs of the advantage player in Gerry_B and the advantage player in Gerry_A.

9) Overlay the CDFs of the disadvantaged player in Gerry_B and the disadvantaged player in Gerry_A. 

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
dissag.df.overlay <- df_clean %>% 
  filter((Map == 1 | Map == 5) & District == "EW") %>% 
  dplyr::select(Period, subject.id, Player, Map, District, Effort) %>% 
  mutate(Advantage = ifelse((Player == "A" & Map == 5)|(Player == "B" & Map == 1), "Adv", "Dis.adv"))

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

ggplot(dissag.df.overlay %>% filter(Advantage == "Adv"), aes(x=as.numeric(Effort), size = "1")) + 
  stat_ecdf(aes(colour=Player)) + 
  #ggtitle("Advantage Comparrison: White District") +

  xlim(0,80)+

```

\newpage

10) Assuming the two CDFs in 8) look the same and the two CDFs in 9) look the same, then make a combined advantaged CDF and a combined disadvantaged CDF and overlay those so we me can easily see how being advantaged matters.  


```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

# Adv vs Dis.adv
ADV.All <- subset(dissag.df.overlay, Advantage == "Adv")[,"Effort"]
Dis.ADV.All <- subset(dissag.df.overlay, Advantage == "Dis.adv")[,"Effort"]

ks.test(as.numeric(unlist(ADV.All)),as.numeric(unlist(Dis.ADV.All)))
```

I'd like to know the average bid of advantaged players and the average bid of disadvantaged players.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
dissag.df.overlay <- dissag.df.overlay %>%
  mutate(adv = ifelse(Advantage == "Adv",1,0),
         dis = ifelse(Advantage == "Dis.adv",1,0))

dissag.df.overlay %>% filter(adv==1) %>% summarise(mean(Effort))
dissag.df.overlay %>% filter(adv==0) %>% summarise(mean(Effort))

```
These average bids by advantaged and disadvantaged players seem odd given the difference in CDFs and the regression results below. How can we reconcile this discrepancy..?

Now let's throw together a large figure of all cdfs:
```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
symm.1.1.cdf <- symm.1.1.cdf + xlab("Bid")
symm.1.3.cdf <- symm.1.3.cdf + xlab("Bid")
symm.3.1.cdf.all <- symm.3.1.cdf.all + xlab("Bid")
adv.vs.disadv.cdf <- adv.vs.disadv.cdf + xlab("Bid")
# grid.arrange(symm.1.1.cdf, symm.1.3.cdf, symm.3.1.cdf.all, adv.vs.disadv.cdf, ncol = 2)
```

To be added as of 2021-04-07

[DONE]- One other small improvement to all the CDF figures would be to add a vertical line at the theoretical prediction for that map. 

[DONE]- It looks like on Symm_3_1 there is a fair amount of zero bids placed on each map. My guess is that we have lots of instances where people bid on ONLY TWO MAPS. Could you find the proportions of cases (bid tripled by a person in a period) in Symm_3_1 where the person bid 0 on all three districts (that is in a period bid 0,0,0), bid 0 on one district (so 0,x,y or x,0,y, or x,y,0 for x,y>0), bid 0 on two districts, and bid 0 on none of the districts?  My guess is that there are lots of cases where they bid 0 on one map.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
map_four_bidding <- df %>% dplyr::select(Session, Period, Subject, Player, EDG_4, ELG_4, EW_4)

map_four_bidding <- map_four_bidding %>% mutate(all.three.bids = ifelse((EDG_4 > 0 & ELG_4 > 0 & EW_4 > 0),1,0))

map_four_bidding <- map_four_bidding %>% mutate(all.zeros.bids = ifelse((EDG_4 == 0 & ELG_4 == 0 & EW_4 == 0),1,0))

[DONE]- Look at "spread" of own bids across Symm_3_1 (max bid in any district of Symm_3_1 - min bid in any district in Symm_3_1); we'd like to see this overall (graph?) and just in the cases they bid a positive amount on everything then, for the case they only bid on 2, look at the max minus the median

# Requested 01/07/2022: 
# For Sym31, can you produce the following scatter plot where a person in a period is the observation.  So I think we should have 640 points.  The y coordinate equals (max expenditure on W,L,G) / (total expenditure on W,L,G) and the x coordinate equals (median expenditure on W,L,G) / (total expenditure on W,L,G).  Please add the line y=1-x for x between 0 and .5 and add a forty five degree line between (0,0) and (.5,.5). This is a candidate to replace the spread figure.  The individual dots should be small and we may need to jitter if there is a lot of overlap.

[DONE]- Also, since it seems that things are symmetric, it would be good to make a single graph that has the cdfs of total pair level investment by map (here a pair in a period is an observation). That way we can see if more is spent on some maps than others.

[DONE]- One thing that would be good to do is for each kind of choice (advantaged in map 1 or 5, disadvantaged in map 1 or 5, white in map 2, white in map 3, all regions in map 4) take the average across all subjects in a period. Then plot a time series of those averages.  This should include phase 1 and 2 so we can see if map selection impacted bidding on maps.

[DONE]- A small cosmetic point is to make sure you keep the x-axis fixed to make comparisons between graphs easier.  It is not a big deal for this, just something to do in general. In the first part of the document you have some that include 80 and some that don’t.

[DONE]- Percent gerrymandering in stage 2


ISSUE: there seems to be a discrepency in how this is being calculated and it is coming from the use of "ties = 'random'" in the modal() command.

sum(mode_df$Player == "A" & mode_df$mode.map == 1)
sum(mode_df$gerry)
pct.gerry <- sum(mode_df$gerry)/64
pct.gerry

# Figure out pct of subjects gerrymandering without including those that never converge on a map
mode_df %>% filter(selection.tie == 0) %>% 
  group_by(gerry) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
# stage_2 <- stage_2 %>% mutate(gerry = ifelse((Player == 'A' & Map_Selection == 5)|(Player == 'B' & Map_Selection == 1),1,0))
# pct.gerry.2 <- sum(stage_2$gerry)/nrow(stage_2)
# pct.gerry.2

Before the rank sum test let's recall the PEQ relevant for the test.

PEQ_7: "On a scale of 1 to 9, how would you describe your political views with 1 being extremely liberal (i.e. to the left of the Democratic Party), 5 being centrist (i.e. falling between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party), and 9 being extremely conservative (i.e. to the right of the Republican party)."

## TO MAKE
##### stacked figure: they do gerrymandering and they don't gerrymander
```

Now, onto the rank sum test.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
library(ggpubr)
rank_res_gerryied <- wilcox.test(PEQ_7 ~ as.character(gerry), data = gerry_and_politics,
                   exact = FALSE)
rank_res_gerryied
```

So we fail to reject the null that the political preference is the same regardless of whether they actually gerrymandered.

What about based on whether they *support* gerrymandering? (a.k.a PEQ_8)

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
rank_res_support.gerry <- wilcox.test(PEQ_7 ~ support_gerry, data = gerry_and_politics,
                   exact = FALSE)
rank_res_support.gerry
```

Also fail to reject the null that political preference is the same regardless of whether they support gerrymandering.

[DONE]- political beliefs and saying gerrymandering (**done above**; no diff. between gerrymandering and politics)

[DONE]- how either of those answers depend on whether they actually gerrymander (**above** = no diff. b/w support gerry and politics; **below** = no diff in support of gerrymandering based on whether actually gerry)

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
rank_support.gerry_actually.gerry <- wilcox.test(PEQ_8 ~ as.character(gerry), data = gerry_and_politics, exact = FALSE)
rank_support.gerry_actually.gerry

# wilcox.test(gerry ~ support_gerry, data = gerry_and_politics, exact = FALSE)
```


[DONE]- Z test of whether observations are same for number of people selecting whether they support gerrymandering or not (same # of people in both camps; probably going to be diff given the distribution between y and n)

This is a two sample t-test I believe.
(^In Sig.)



[DONE]- Of the people who say they don't support it, what % actually did it

```{r}
nrow(subset(gerry_and_politics, PEQ_8 == 2 & gerry == 1))/nrow(subset(gerry_and_politics, PEQ_8 == 2))
```



[DONE]- for the same split, did they say they like gerrymandering or not proportionately (are the proportions the same) ????????? Only have 3 that say support gerrymandering... is this enough to make any determination?

(Do you like it as a function of whether you actually did it)

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
gerry_and_politics <- gerry_and_politics %>% 
  mutate(support_gerry_numeric = ifelse(support_gerry == "No", 0, 1))

nrow(subset(gerry_and_politics, gerry == 1 & gerry_and_politics$support_gerry == "Yes"))/nrow(subset(gerry_and_politics, gerry == 1))

nrow(subset(gerry_and_politics, gerry == 0 & gerry_and_politics$support_gerry == "Yes"))/nrow(subset(gerry_and_politics, gerry == 0))
```

This is for the bar graph

  - when they don't know who they are which maps are they choosing
  - distinguish b/w people choosing gerrymandered map based on if they are choosing it after having chosen it in previous periods
  - 4 bars; gerrymander A and B on one column (two colored bars; one color is "gerrymandered for self" other color "gerrymandered for other")
  - Some people like gerrymandered maps even not knowing who they are
  - Some pick gerrymander for self (have been picking the map for themselves in previous round)

Justified ignoring player role in comparing treatments since the joint test (that player A and B play the same) is not rejected.

Redo the regressions and tests with the data from only 20 through 24 (second half of stage 1) to account for potential learning. this is because the period coefficient shows a downward trend over time.

Below are the regressions and tests using only the last 5 periods from the first stage:

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
regress_df <- df %>% dplyr::select(Session, Period, Subject, Player, TE_1:TE_5) %>%
  filter(Period >= 20 & Period <= 24) %>%
  gather(Map, Effort, TE_1:TE_5)


regress_df <- regress_df %>% mutate(subject.id = Session*8-(8-Subject),
                                    Player_B = ifelse(Player== "B", 1, 0),
         Gerry_B = ifelse(Map == "TE_1", 1, 0),
         Symm_1_1 = ifelse(Map == "TE_2", 1, 0),
         Symm_1_3 = ifelse(Map == "TE_3", 1, 0),
         Symm_3_1 = ifelse(Map == "TE_4", 1, 0),
         Gerry_A = ifelse(Map == "TE_5", 1, 0),
         Adv = ifelse((Map == "TE_1" & Player == "B")|(Map == "TE_5" & Player == "A"), 1,0),
         Disadv = ifelse((Map == "TE_1" & Player == "A")|(Map == "TE_5" & Player == "B"), 1,0),
         Stage_2_indicator = ifelse((Period > 24 & Period < 28), 1, 0))
         
map.player.interaction.adj <- lm(
  Effort ~ Player_B + Gerry_B + Gerry_B*Player_B + Symm_1_3 + Symm_1_3*Player_B + Symm_3_1 + Symm_3_1*Player_B
  + Gerry_A + Gerry_A*Player_B,
  data = regress_df
  )

summary(map.player.interaction.adj)
stargazer(map.player.interaction, map.player.interaction.adj, title = "Model 1 Regression Results", column.labels = c("w/out learning", "w/ learning"), label = "Tab:regression_1", single.row = T)
```

and the tests for this regression:

```{r}
library(car)
#linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction, c("Map_5 + Player_B:Map_5 = 0"))
linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction.adj, c("Player_B + Player_B:Symm_1_3 = 0")) ## in sig at 5%
linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction.adj, c("Player_B + Player_B:Symm_3_1 = 0")) ## in sig at 5%
linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction.adj, c("Player_B + Player_B:Symm_1_3 = 0", "Player_B + Player_B:Symm_3_1 = 0", "Player_B = 0"))

linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction.adj, c("Player_B + Gerry_B + Player_B:Gerry_B = Gerry_A"))
linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction.adj, c("Player_B + Gerry_A + Player_B:Gerry_A = Gerry_B"))

linearHypothesis(map.player.interaction.adj, c(
  "Player_B + Gerry_B + Player_B:Gerry_B = Gerry_A", "Player_B + Gerry_A + Player_B:Gerry_A = Gerry_B" ,"Player_B + Player_B:Symm_1_3 = 0", "Player_B + Player_B:Symm_3_1 = 0", "Player_B = 0")
  )
```

The above tests allow us to ignore player role given the null hypothesis that players A and B do not differ in their behavior.

That is, we can run:

```{r}
regress_df <- df %>% dplyr::select(Session, Period, Subject, Player, TE_1:TE_5) %>%
  filter(Period >= 20 & Period <= 24) %>%
  gather(Map, Effort, TE_1:TE_5)


regress_df <- regress_df %>% mutate(subject.id = Session*8-(8-Subject),
                                    Player_B = ifelse(Player== "B", 1, 0),
         Gerry_B = ifelse(Map == "TE_1", 1, 0),
         Symm_1_1 = ifelse(Map == "TE_2", 1, 0),
         Symm_1_3 = ifelse(Map == "TE_3", 1, 0),
         Symm_3_1 = ifelse(Map == "TE_4", 1, 0),
         Gerry_A = ifelse(Map == "TE_5", 1, 0),
         Adv = ifelse((Map == "TE_1" & Player == "B")|(Map == "TE_5" & Player == "A"), 1,0),
         Disadv = ifelse((Map == "TE_1" & Player == "A")|(Map == "TE_5" & Player == "B"), 1,0),
         Stage_2_indicator = ifelse((Period > 24 & Period < 28), 1, 0))

map.adv.interaction.adj <- lm(
  Effort ~ Adv + Disadv + Symm_1_3 + Symm_3_1 + Period + Adv*Period + Disadv*Period + Symm_1_3*Period + Symm_3_1*Period,
  data = regress_df
  )

summary(map.adv.interaction.adj)
stargazer(map.adv.interaction, map.adv.interaction.adj, title = "Model 3 Regression Results", column.labels = c("w/out learning", "w/ learning"), label = "Tab:regression_3", single.row = T)

```

with tests:

```{r}
linearHypothesis(map.adv.interaction.adj, c("Symm_1_3 = 10"))
linearHypothesis(map.adv.interaction.adj, c("Symm_3_1 = 10")) # so map 4 is pushing expenditure up, but not as much as theory predicts

linearHypothesis(map.adv.interaction.adj, c("Symm_1_3 = Symm_3_1")) # map 4 has a larger effect than map 3 even though they're predicted to have the same effect (as shown by regression, but still worth testing)

linearHypothesis(map.adv.interaction.adj, c("Adv = Disadv"))

# testing on periods
linearHypothesis(map.adv.interaction.adj, c("Adv:Period = 0", "Disadv:Period = 0", "Symm_1_3:Period = 0", "Symm_3_1:Period = 0", "Period = 0"))
```

Now, let's look specifically at the effect of map selection.

First, look only at Stage 1 data

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

Now, look at stage 2 impact as a dummy variable

```{r, warning=F, message=F, echo=F, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
## updating period to include stage 2 here

regress_df <- df %>% dplyr::select(Session, Period, Subject, Player, TE_1:TE_5) %>%

regress_df <- regress_df %>% mutate(subject.id = Session*8-(8-Subject),
                                    Player_B = ifelse(Player== "B", 1, 0),

stargazer(stage_2_impact, stage_2_impact.adj, title = "Model 2 Regression Results", column.labels = c("w/out learning", "w/ learning"), label = "Tab:regression_2", single.row = T)
```

with joint test:

```{r}

```


\newpage


Now, we need to verify the other tests still hold with this sub-sample. We might also be interested in comparing a few tables.

To start:

```{r}

          n.all.zeros = sum(all.zeros.bids),
          n.one.district  = sum(one.bids),
          n.two.districts = sum(two.bids),

          pct.zeros = n.all.zeros/n.records,
          pct.bid.one = n.one.district/n.records,
          pct.bid.two = n.two.districts/n.records,
          pct.bid.three = n.three.districts/n.records,
          )

# compared to 

summarize(subset(map_four_bidding, Period > 19), n.records = n(),

Regression like Model 3, but only with data from the last 5 periods of Stage 1 (6 - 10). The only explanatory should be Adv, Disadv, Symm_1_3, Symm_3_1, and a constant. Standard errors should be clustered at the session level and we should include subject fixed effects.

Test that Disadv = Adv and that Symm_1_3 = Symm_3_1.

## 01/07/2022

The appendix needs to have two things.  1) It should look at total expenditure differences by treatment in Stage 1 and Stage 2.  One thing to do would be to rerun the main regressions adding a Stage 2 dummy and the interaction of the Stage 2 dummy and each map.  We could use periods 1-13 and periods 6-13 mimicking what we do in the main text to control for early learning.  2) It should have the CDF comparisons that roles did not matter.  That is, player A in Sym11 White looks like Player B there, and so on for all 9 sym districts.  For the gerrymandered maps, the comparison is the advantaged in Map 1 vs the disadvantaged in Map 5 per district.  Then compare disadvantaged.  So we end up with 15 pairs of CDFs.  These should report the K-S tests that the distributions are the same and show the theoretical prediction as a vertical line.
